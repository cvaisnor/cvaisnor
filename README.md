# 👋 Hi there!
### I am currently practicing Python 🐍 , building ML models 🖥 , or learning something new 📚 !

### About Me:
#### Past: 
* I got interested in AI in 2015 when I saw how neural networks improved themselves without being explicitly programmed
* I graduated with a __Managerial Economics B.S. from UC Davis__ in __June of 2021__
* In August 2021 I completed the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

#### Present:
* Getting familiar with Deep Learning libraries
* Working with a team for the IBM / University of Florida 10-week Hackathon
* Reading as much as I can about data and coding topics

#### Future:
* I plan to start a Master's Program in Data Science in Spring or Fall of 2022 (actively applying)
* Work as a machine learning engineer / data science intern before the Master's program starts
* I want to collaborate with others in AI topics and build tools that hopefully can change the world

## Please reach out if you want to collaborate or chat! 💬
Having like-minded people to share ideas with is exactly how great things start!
